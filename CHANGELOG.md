# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Animated spinner on TTY for long-running operations in `agents`, `status`, and `stop` commands
- `agents`: live scanning animation, per-agent ✓/✗ health symbol, and found-N summary line
- `status`: ✓/✗ symbols for local daemon and cloud relay; animated dots during relay HTTP check
- `start`: prints confirmation and log path before Unix double-fork

### Changed

- One-shot commands (`agents`, `status`, `stop`) suppress `hub.*` INFO logs to keep output clean; daemon (`start`) retains full INFO logging
- `stop`: stale PID lock file is auto-removed; static "Stopping..." message on non-TTY, spinner on TTY
- `agent start`: cleaner output formatting

### Fixed

- `_detach_windows()` was accidentally embedded inside `_spinning_wait()` — restored as a top-level function
- `Callable` import moved to module level; removed string-quoted type annotation
- `_spinning_wait` now checks condition before sleeping, avoiding a full interval of unnecessary delay for fast operations
- Test fixtures: `mock_client.is_closed = False` added to prevent `httpx.AsyncClient` mock bypass in `test_agent_registry` and `test_dispatcher`
- CLI stop tests updated to mock `_spinning_wait` directly instead of patching `time`

## [0.1.7.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- Updated project metadata

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Background daemon for `hybro-hub start` (Unix double-fork, Windows detached re-launch); `--foreground` / `-f` keeps the process in the terminal
- `hybro-hub stop` — SIGTERM with timeout, then SIGKILL; removes `~/.hybro/hub.lock` when the daemon exits
- Exclusive instance lock and PID file at `~/.hybro/hub.lock` (fcntl on Unix, `msvcrt` on Windows)
- Rotating daemon logs at `~/.hybro/hub.log` (10 MB × 3 files)
- `hybro-hub status` reports local daemon state (running / stopped / stale PID) and clearer cloud relay errors (401 vs other HTTP vs unreachable)
- CLI tests for `status`, plus coverage for lock, start, and stop paths

### Changed

- `load_config` logs successful file loads at DEBUG instead of INFO for quieter user-facing CLI output

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- Show active/inactive agent breakdown in `hybro-hub status` (total, active, and inactive counts displayed separately)



## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-17

### Changed

- Make `a2a-adapter` a core dependency (no longer requires separate install)
- License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0
- Emit `artifact_update` instead of `agent_token` for streaming

### Fixed

- Prevent resource leaks in dispatcher, registry, relay, and queue

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- hybro-hub should error out if a wrong model name is provided

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing via trusted publishers

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Initial release of hybro-hub
- Hub daemon for bridging local A2A agents to hybro.ai relay
- Python client for Hybro Gateway API
- Agent registry for managing local agents
- Relay client for cloud communication
- CLI interface (`hybro-hub` command)
- OpenClaw and n8n CLI support
- Disk-backed publish queue for reliability
- API key auth for publish, SSE read timeout

### Fixed

- Improved graceful shutdown and task tracking
- Tighten port enumeration correctness and thread safety
- Replace psutil port enumeration with unprivileged OS-native strategies
- Forward all relay event types to daemon
- Stabilize agent identity across restarts
- Preserve FIFO retry queue
- Improve cross-platform support
